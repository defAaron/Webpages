Hello there!

Welcome to Aaron's HTMl/CSS/Javascript programs. These programs were all created in the 2023-2024 school year.

This repository includes programs that range from easy coding (ex: Aaron-ResumeWebsite.html and bistro-news.html) to complicated but fascinating projects (ex: cybersecurity.html), so feel free to explore!
