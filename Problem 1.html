        <strong>The first few Geometry Dash levels are suitable for those who have never played the game, and even ever touched a video game. </strong>
        <p></p>
        <strong>The basic physics of the video game are extremely simple to understand. </strong>
        <p></p>
        <strong>The average percent a new player might get for the first five levels might be around 10 to 50 percent.</strong>
        <p></p>
        <strong>Here are the first 10 levels:</strong>

        <ul>
            __ Stereo Madness __
            <p></p>
            __ Back on Track __
            <p></p>
            __ Polargeist __
            <p></p>
            __ Dry Out __
            <p></p>
            __ Base After Base __
            <p></p>
            __ Can't Let Go __
            <p></p>
            __ Jumper __
            <p></p>
            __ Time Machine __
            <p></p>
            __ Cycles __
            <p></p>
            __ Xstep __
        </ul>
