                    <h2>New Skills and Knowledge Gained</h2>
                    <p>During this course, I have gained a range of new skills and knowledge, particularly in coding and web development. I learned how to write and troubleshoot code, create webpages using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and understand the basics of cybersecurity. Additionally, I developed soft skills such as problem-solving, collaboration, and effective communication by working on projects both independently and with my peers.</p>

                    <h2>Challenges Overcome</h2>
                    <p>One particularly challenging moment occurred when I encountered a small but important bug in my cybersecurity code. It turned out to be a typo, but it took a considerable amount of time to identify. Despite the frustration, I reached out to my friends for help. Together, we reviewed the code line by line until we found the error. This experience taught me the importance of collaboration and persistence in problem-solving.</p>

                    <h2>Understanding of Technology and Its Applications</h2>
                    <p>My understanding of technology and its applications has significantly broadened over the course. Learning about the history of technology and its various applications, including web development, cybersecurity, and other fields, has given me a deeper appreciation for how integral technology is in our daily lives. I now understand not just the technical aspects but also the practical and societal impacts of technology, which has inspired me to continue exploring this field.</p>
